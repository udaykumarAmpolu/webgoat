== Blind XXE assignment

In the previous page we showed you how you can ping a server with a XXE attack, in this assignment try to make a DTD
which will upload the contents of ~/.webgoat/plugin/XXE/secret.txt to our server.
For Linux: `/home/USER/.webgoat/XXE/secret.txt`, for Windows this would be `c:/Users/USER/.webgoat/XXE/secret.txt`
If you use the Docker based WebGoat environment this file is located here: `/root/.webgoat/XXE/secret.txt`

Try to upload this file using the following endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/XXE/ping?text=[contents_file]` (NOTE: this endpoint is under your full control)

You can login to the Docker container as follows: `docker exec -i -t <<name>> /bin/bash`
